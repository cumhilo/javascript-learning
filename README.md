<!-- Information -->
# Welcome to my javascript learning project

This period will be divided in stages, I will do several simultaneous projects in the same repository, so I can keep track of my learning and what I have learned new about it.

## Why did I decide to learn JavaScript

Well, it is for a simple reason, which is that I want to get a little more into the frontend and backend world, and this language will allow me all that, plus I want to create new joint projects with java and javascript, so I need this knowledge.

### How long will this process take

Since I already have programming knowledge, I don't think it will take me much longer than with my first "programming language" I learned, which is java, but I estimate that it will take about 3 months or so.
